## Built With

This project is built upon canvas and a lots of javascript.

## Getting Started

You have to manage a metro network.
There are three types of station. Triangles, Squares and Circles. In each one appears passengers that want to go to another stations of their type.
You have to use the red, blue and yellow metro line to join stations and let the passengers travel when the train arrives!
If more than 6 passengers accumulate in one station you lose.
Use the mousedown and mouseup to connect stations with tracks. The amount of available tracks increase upon time.
